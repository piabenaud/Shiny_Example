# Shiny_Example
This repo is home to an example interactive map made with RShiny and leaflet.

The example plots [CEH Land Cover] as extracted on a 25km grid across Great Britain.

Made by [Pia Benaud] it is a simplified and updated version of [SoilErosionMap] shinyapp made in support of the publication by [Benaud et al. (2020)] *National-scale geodata describe widespread accelerated soil erosion.* 

The original code drew inspiration from the Rshiny [Superzip] example.

Follow these links to learn more about [R Shiny] and how it can be integrated with [Leaflet for R], bringing the power of one of the most popular open-source JavaScript libraries for interactive maps.
